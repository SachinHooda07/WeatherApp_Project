Weather App :- 

I designed and developed a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver real-time weather information for any location worldwide. The app features a clean and responsive user interface, enabling users to search for cities and instantly view detailed weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions. Leveraging a weather API, the app ensures precise and up-to-date information while maintaining optimal performance across devices. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate APIs seamlessly and create interactive, user-centric applications, further refining my skills in modern web development.

1. Real-Time Weather Data: The app fetches current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure using a weather API like OpenWeatherMap.
2. Geolocation: Leveraging the Geolocation API, the app automatically detects the userâ€™s location to display relevant weather data. Users can also manually input a location to check weather information for different regions.
3. Responsive Design: Utilizing HTML and CSS, the app features a clean, intuitive interface that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
4. Dynamic Updates: JavaScript is used to dynamically update the weather information on the page without needing to refresh, enhancing the user experience.
   
*Technical Aspects* :-
- Frontend: The app is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality and interactions.
- API Integration: It integrates with a weather API to fetch and display real-time weather data.
- User Interface: The design focuses on user experience with a simple and intuitive layout, featuring icons and graphics to represent different weather conditions.
